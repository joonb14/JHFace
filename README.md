# arcface-tflite

This project is heavily based on the well implemented [arcface-tf2](https://github.com/peteryuX/arcface-tf2)<br>
The things that rise error when converting the model to tflite was changed.<br>
<br>
### Training the Model
checkout the [TensorFlow ArcFace.ipynb](https://github.com/joonb14/arcface-tflite/blob/main/TensorFlow%20ArcFace.ipynb).<br>
### Converting the Model to TensorFlow Lite
checkout the [TFLite conversion.ipynb](https://github.com/joonb14/arcface-tflite/blob/main/TFLite%20conversion.ipynb).<br>
### For Face Matching
checkout the [Face Identification with Centroid Vector.ipynb](https://github.com/joonb14/arcface-tflite/blob/main/Face%20Identification%20with%20Centroid%20Vector.ipynb).<br>
